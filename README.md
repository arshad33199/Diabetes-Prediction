## Problem Statement:
â€¢	This is a Machine Learning project in which I am using Classification models. I am trying to predict diabetes patient by the training the dataset.



## Approach:

## Data Preprocessing:
In this section I am doing all the Data cleaning and analysis. 

In the outcome column 0 represent non diabetic patient and 1 represent diabetic patient.

seprating the data and label.

This all the process i followed for test dataset as well and made a training and test dataset to feed in the Machine learning algorithm.



## Model Implementation:

I used StandardScaler and classifier to fit the dataset.

the training data accuracy score is 0.78%

the test data accuracy score is 0.76%
